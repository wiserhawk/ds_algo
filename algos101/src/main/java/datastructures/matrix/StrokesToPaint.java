Problem Statement
Alex wants to paint a picture but hates taking the brush off the canvas. In one stroke, 
Alex can only paint the same colored cells which are joined via some edge.

Given the painting, determine the minimum number of strokes to completely paint the picture.

Take for example, the canvas with height given by h = 3 and width given by w = 5 is to be painted with picture picture=[“aabba”, “aabba”, “aaaca”], 
the diagram below shows the 4 strokes needed to paint the canvas.

        Strokes
 Canvas  1   	2  	3 	4
 aabba   aa  	bb   	a
 aabba   aa  	bb   	a
 aaaca   aaa    	c 	a
